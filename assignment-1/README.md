<center>Assignment 1</center>

#### Note

- This is the first assignment for this course, you should read the [guidelines](https://github.com/xuyige/PRML-Spring20-FDU/blob/master/README.md) and consent to the agreement before doing it.

- The deadline of this assignment is **<span style="color: red">Apr 15, 2020</span>** (for 2 weeks), before the course start.

- For instructions of submission, please also see the [guidelines](https://github.com/xuyige/PRML-Spring20-FDU/blob/master/README.md).

#### Description

##### Part I

In this part, you are going to design 3 gaussian distribution, each of distribution indicates label A, label B, and label C, respectively. Then construct a dataset sampling from these distributions.


##### Part II

In this part, you are required to construct 2 linear classification models: a generative model and a discriminative model. Meanwhile, you are required to compare their differences.

##### Part III

In this part, you can reorganize the scale of your dataset or the adjust the overlap between different gaussian distributions.


#### Requirements

- A report named `report.pdf` is required. In your report, you should include a link to your datasets (please do NOT push your dataset to this GitHub repository), the description for your models, the analysis for your models, and the command lines for running your source code.

- A small dataset (no more than 20Kb) named `*.data` is required for running your source code. This file should have the same format as your datasets mentioned above.

- A plain python source code named `source.py` is required. Notice that the source code should be as clean as possible.
